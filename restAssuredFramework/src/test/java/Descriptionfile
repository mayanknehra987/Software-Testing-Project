//Framework- organize your code in such a manner , where we can achieve the maintanance, reusability, 
// In Framework:- Data driven Testing
				// Integration with CI/CD
				// Enhanced Reporting (Logs)is important
				// Proper folder structure
				// Rest API (Generic in nature)
				// Payload management 
				// Flexibility and Scalability
				// Proper environment (QA, Preprod) is important for good rest assured framework
				
// which framework we will use:- custom hybrid automation framework
								//include( data driven + module driven +paylaod called generic framework)
								//support rest api, jira api, twiter api, github api we will automate, soap automation support also, graph ql query also support
// Tech Stack (explain your framework):- 1. Java and rest assured 
				// maven and testng - testing framework build automation
				// assertion - assertj, testng
				// payload management- pojo classes
				// reporting - allure 
				// test data- json file, excel- apache poi, fillow
				// linting and JDK , Git- sonarlint
//pojo:- plain old java object
		// normal class which is mapped with the payload that we are sending
		// it will help in serialization and deserialization
		// jsonschema2pojo using convert java object to java string(byte string)
//Framework structure
